# Password Reset Feature

## Overview
The password reset feature allows users who have forgotten their passwords to securely create a new one. 
This feature enhances user experience and security by providing a self-service option for account recovery.

## How It Works

1. **Initiate Reset**: On the login page, users can click on a "Forgot Password" link.

2. **Enter Email**: Users are prompted to enter their registered email address.

3. **Token Generation**: The system generates a unique, time-limited token associated with the user's account.

4. **Email Notification**: An email containing a password reset link with the token is sent to the user's registered email address.

5. **Reset Page**: Clicking the link in the email takes the user to a secure password reset page.

6. **New Password**: User enters and confirms their new password.

7. **Password Update**: Upon submission, the system verifies the token and updates the user's password.

8. **Confirmation**: The user receives a confirmation of a successful password reset.

## Security Measures

- Tokens are unique and time-limited (expiring after a set period, e.g., 1 hour).
- Tokens are single-use and invalidated after a password reset.
- Password reset links are sent only to registered email addresses.
- New passwords must meet the application's password strength requirements.
- All password reset attempts (successful or failed) are logged for security auditing.

## Implementation Details

- **Token Generation**: Utilizes Java's `UUID.randomUUID()` for creating unique tokens.
- **Email Service**: Uses JavaMail API to send password reset emails.
- **Password Encryption**: Passwords are hashed using [bcrypt] before storage.
- **Database Updates**: User passwords are updated in the database only after successful token verification.


## Usage

To use this feature in development or testing:

1. Run the application and navigate to the login page.
2. Click on "Forgot Password" and follow the prompts.
3. Check the console or configured email service for the reset link (in development environments).

## Notes

- Regularly review and update the password reset feature to maintain security standards.
